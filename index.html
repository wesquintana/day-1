        <ul>
          I was born in Texas, but moved to the Boise area when I was 6.
        </ul>
        <ul>
          The only ranked competitive game I consistently play is Puyo Puyo
          Tetris, but I'm a huge Overwatch fan.
        </ul>
        <ul>
          I have a decent amount of java and one of the C languages, but most of
          what I remember is that pointers were confusing.
